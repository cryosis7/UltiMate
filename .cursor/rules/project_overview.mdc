# Ulti-Mate Project Overview

## Purpose
Ulti-Mate is a Garmin Connect IQ Watch Application designed to assist Ultimate Frisbee players. It tracks game timing, scoring, and provides gender ratio reminders based on the standard ABBA pattern.

## Key Features
- **Game Timer**: Tracks total elapsed time since the start of the game.
- **Point Timer**: Tracks duration of the current point.
- **Score Tracking**: Counts completed points for Dark and Light teams.
- **Gender Ratio Indicator**: Displays "A" or "B" to indicate the gender ratio for the current point, following the ABBA pattern (A, B, B, A, A, B, B...).
- **Undo Score**: Press back button to undo the last scored point, restoring the previous point timer and gender ratio.
- **Pause Menu**: Custom menu to Resume, Save (and exit), or Discard (and exit) the session.
- **Confirm Exit Dialog**: Safety confirmation when pressing back with no scores to undo.
- **Activity Recording**: Records the game as a generic sport activity.

## Target Platform
- **SDK Version**: **Minimum SDK 1.4.0**. This is an older framework level; avoid modern Connect IQ APIs introduced in later versions (e.g., System 3 or System 4 features) unless strictly verified.
- **Devices**: Supports a wide range of Garmin devices including Vivoactive, Fenix, Forerunner, Epix, Instinct, Venu, and Edge series. See `manifest.xml` for the full list.
