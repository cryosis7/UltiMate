# Ulti-Mate Project Overview

## Purpose
Ulti-Mate is a Garmin Connect IQ Watch Application designed to assist Ultimate Frisbee players. It tracks game timing, scoring, and provides gender ratio reminders based on the standard ABBA pattern.

## Key Features
- **Game Timer**: Tracks total elapsed time since the start of the game.
- **Point Timer**: Tracks duration of the current point.
- **Score Tracking**: Counts completed points.
- **Gender Ratio Indicator**: Displays "A" or "B" to indicate the gender ratio for the current point, following the ABBA pattern (A, B, B, A, A, B, B...).

## Target Platform
- **SDK Version**: **Minimum SDK 1.4.0**. This is an older framework level; avoid modern Connect IQ APIs introduced in later versions (e.g., System 3 or System 4 features) unless strictly verified.
- **Devices**: Supports a wide range of Garmin devices including Vivoactive, Fenix, Forerunner, Epix, and Edge series. See `manifest.xml` for the full list.

## Core Files
- `source/UltiMateApp.mc`: Application entry point.
- `source/UltiMateView.mc`: Main display logic and game state calculation.
- `source/UltiMateDelegate.mc`: Input handling (button presses).
